SariSmart
A smart, simple Point-of-Sale and Inventory web app for sari-sari stores.

🎯 Problem

Sari-sari store owners waste time manually tracking sales and stock (writing on paper, guessing when to restock). When multiple customers buy at once, manual tracking becomes chaotic — often leading to lost sales data and wasted restock time.

💡 Solution

A lightweight, McDo-style web app that lets store owners tap items as they sell — instantly updating stock, recording sales, and reminding them when to restock.
No need to write, no spreadsheets, no hassle.
